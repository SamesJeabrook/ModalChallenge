# Brandworkz Modal

This challenge is to test your creativity and technical ability.  A chance to show off. The requirements are simple.

We would like to have a simple reuseable component that pops up a Modal.

## Requirements

* It must be built using React
* It must be highly configurable
* It must be styled

You can not use someone elses plugin to create the modal, it can be styled in anyway you please (stylesheet, styled-components, etc).
You can add as many other packages as you please, but please provide an explanation into your choices and decisions behind the additional technologies you include.

We have provided a basic webpack configuration that can be run from using `yarn start` command.
